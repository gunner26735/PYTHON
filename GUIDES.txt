WEB Scrapping:
    In this we are using BeautifulSoup library of bs4
    Steps:
        1)get the request fro requests class
        2) fetch the search result 
        3) To print it use requests.text variable 
        4) through .prettify() (of BeautifulSoup) print the data EX:  "  fettchsoup = BeautifulSoup(r.text, "html.parser") "

    Another thing to scrap out some specific content then we have to use find method 
    For example look in WebScarpping/specific_scraping file
