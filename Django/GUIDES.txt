How to run an APP:
    S1  :The new app which we created using command "python manage.py startapp app_name". First navigate in it.

DTL : Django Template Language 
    It already in use in settings.py
    In these templates we are going to create our HTML Files For that:
        S1  :Create a Directory in root directory name it anything 
        S2  :Now in this directory create your HTML Files
        S3  :Now, we have to set this directory in "settings.py" for python to know
        S4  :In templates Dictionary Key add your directory path like this  
            For example : [os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'templates')]
        
        S5  :After setting the path we have render those files in "views.py" of app which you want to display
            Like this : return render(request,'hello.html')
        
        S6  :we can also pass dictionary inside render as a 3rd parameter
        S7  :To access that dictionary in html file we use {{KEY}}
        S8  :To fetch values of GET and POST passed in "views.py" use request.GET[] OR request.POST[]   

When USING POST we have to send a CSRF verfication code which is neccessary for protection. It is by default provided in "MIDDELWARE"
    By using jinja code we have to send token   " {% csrf_token %} "    like this..
